# VueScanLicenced.ds.recipe

            _Last updated 2021-12-23 20:01:50Z_

            - **Description**: Downloads VueScan, creates an installer package with the app and the needed authorization file,
and copies it to a local path of your choosing.
This recipe requires the hansen-m-recipes (Matt Hansen) repo.

Carefully follow the instructions in the pkg recipe to set up the proper licensing information.

Input keys:
- DS_PKGS_PATH is the destination path for the copy. A trailing slash is not required/desired.
  The path does not need to be on the same volume as the cache, as the pkg is being duplicated.
- DS_NAME is what the final package will be called, regardless of what was generated by the parent recipe.
  It defaults to %NAME% (just the app name).
