        - **Description**: 
Unpack Pantone Color Manager

You will still need to activate PCM with your PANTONE registration.
Either by registering your PANTONE color guide or buy purchasing an application license separately.

If you don't have X-Rite Device Services installed, this package will also install that to support calibration
via spectrophotometer.
