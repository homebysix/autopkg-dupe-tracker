            - **Description**: Downloads the latest FileMaker Pro Advanced full installer given the supplied MAJOR_VERSION and imports it into a munki_repo.

When purchasing FileMaker, the order confirmation email includes a URL which takes you to a page to download the latest full installer. Despite indicating the link will expire, almost a year later and our own account purchase link still works. You will need to supply that link in the SEARCH_URL variable.
