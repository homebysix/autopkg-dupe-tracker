# AmadeusPro2.ds.recipe

            _Last updated 2021-12-23 20:01:50Z_

            - **Description**: Downloads latest version of Amadeus Pro, packages it, and then copies and then copies the package to 
a local path of your choosing.
Input keys:
- DS_PKGS_PATH is the destination path for the copy. A trailing slash is not required/desired.
  The path does not need to be on the same volume as the cache.
- DS_NAME is what the final package will be called, regardless of what was generated by the parent recipe.
  It defaults to %NAME% (just the app name).
Note that a previous version of this recipe chain let you have a separate value for NAME and APPNAME.
You should delete APPNAME from your override and adjust the value of DS_NAME (since it defaulted to APPNAME).
