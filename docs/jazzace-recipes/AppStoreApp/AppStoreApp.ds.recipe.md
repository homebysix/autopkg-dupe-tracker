# AppStoreApp.ds.recipe

            _Last updated 2021-12-23 19:58:07Z_

            - **Description**: Note: Please read information on how to use the AppStoreApp recipes in the ReadMe
in Nick McSpadden's recipe repo; they do not function in the same way as other AutoPkg recipes:
    https://github.com/autopkg/nmcspadden-recipes

Should the parent pkg recipe generate a pkg, this recipe will copy it to the local path of your choosing.

Input keys:
- DS_PKGS_PATH is the destination path for the copy. A trailing slash is not required/desired.
  The path does not need to be on the same volume as the cache, as the pkg is being duplicated.
- DS_NAME is what the final package will be called, regardless of what was generated by the parent recipe.
  It defaults to %NAME% (just the app name).
