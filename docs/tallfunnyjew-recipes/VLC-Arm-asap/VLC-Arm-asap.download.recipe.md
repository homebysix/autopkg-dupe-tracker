# VLC-Arm-asap.download.recipe

        _Last updated 2021-12-23 20:01:50Z_

        - **Description**: Downloads the VERY latest VLC available for Arm-based Macs. Do NOT use this recipe for Intel Macs.

NOTE: as VLAN DOESN'T update their sparkle feed ASAP, my recipe checks the VLAN website instead.
This allows downloads of the most recent releases as soon as they're available.
