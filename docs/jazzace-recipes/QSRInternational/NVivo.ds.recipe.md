            - **Description**: Downloads the latest version of NVivo (Version 20 and later), 
packages it, and then copies the package to a local path of your choosing.
Input keys:
- DS_PKGS_PATH is the destination path for the copy. A trailing slash is not required/desired.
  The path does not need to be on the same volume as the cache.
- DS_NAME is what the final package will be called, regardless of what was generated by the parent recipe.
  It defaults to %NAME% (just the app name).
