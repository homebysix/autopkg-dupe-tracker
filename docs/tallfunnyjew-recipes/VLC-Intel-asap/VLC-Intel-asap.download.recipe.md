# VLC-Intel-asap.download.recipe

        _Last updated 2021-12-23 19:58:07Z_

        - **Description**: Downloads the VERY latest VLC available for INTEL Macs. Do not use this version of VLC if you're on a newer Mac with Apple/Arm Silicon.

NOTE: as VLAN DOESN'T update their sparkle feed ASAP, my recipe checks the VLAN website instead.
This allows downloads of the most recent releases as soon as they're available.
