            - **Description**: Downloads the most recent version of Glyphs 2 and imports
it into Munki.

This may sometimes include beta releases, a limitation which is
due to an unconventional way in which they manage the feed as a means
to make pre-releases available. Please see the Glyps2.download recipe for
more details.
