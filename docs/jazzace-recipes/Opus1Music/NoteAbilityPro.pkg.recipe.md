# NoteAbilityPro.pkg.recipe

            _Last updated 2021-12-23 20:01:50Z_

            - **Description**: Downloads latest version of NoteAbilityPro 3 and extracts the package installer.
If there is no new installer, the file will not be extracted from the archive.
Since Version 2 was 32-bit, this recipe no longer supports it.
Note that the app is unsigned by the developer (hence the lack of a CodeSignatureVerifier processor).
