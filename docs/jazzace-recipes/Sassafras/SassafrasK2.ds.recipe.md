# SassafrasK2.ds.recipe

            _Last updated 2021-12-23 20:01:50Z_

            - **Description**: Fetches the latest Sassafras K2 Mac installer (specified by PRODUCT) for versions 7.0-7.6
and copies it to a local/mounted drive.
This could be useful for setting up your own Client Self-updates server.

For versions 7.7 and later, use the new SassafrasClient/Admin/Server recipes.

Local Input keys:
- DS_PKGS_PATH is the path to the folder where you would like to locate the copied package (trailing slash not required/desired).
  The path does not need to be on the same volume as the cache, as the pkg is being duplicated.
- DS_NAME is what the final package will be called, regardless of what was generated by the parent recipe.
  It defaults to K2%PRODUCT%-Self-Updates (e.g., K2Client-Self-Updates).
