    <h1>XcodeEdu.pkg.recipe</h1>
    <p>Last refresh: 2021-12-25 04:50:28</p>
    <p>Desciption: Creates an installer package from a supplied .xip file downloaded using Facebook's "xcode.downloader" 
        recipe, and extracted using their "xcode.extract" recipe from their AutoPkg repo 
        "com.github.facebook.Recipes-for-AutoPkg".

        This recipe also adds a postflight script to the package, to install the command-line tools and configure these 
        for lab Mac use.

        Due to Apple signed packages not being able to install to SIP protected areas when called via a postflight, the
        additional packages are installed by a self-destrictible LaunchDaemon which is called immediately after the 
        "parent" Xcode installer is complete. This LaunchDaemon runs a script (both stored in /tmp) which installs all 3
        additional component packages, and then unloads and deletes the launchdaemon, and itself.

        This kind of installation package would typically be used in lab enviroments, where users don't have admin 
        rights.
