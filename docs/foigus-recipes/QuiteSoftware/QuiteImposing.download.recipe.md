            - **Description**: Downloads the latest Quite Imposing disk image.

Support for Plus or non-Plus versions of Quite Imposing is available from the PLUS variable, which should be set to "plus" for Quite Imposing Plus or an empty string for regular Quite Imposing.

Language support is available via the LANGUAGE variable, although I can't find any other languages to download to test.

Code signature verification isn't possible because the installer isn't signed.
