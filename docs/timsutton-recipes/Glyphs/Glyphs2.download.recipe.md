            - **Description**: Downloads the most recent version of Glyphs 2.

This may sometimes include beta releases, a limitation which is
due to an unconventional way in which they manage the feed as a means
to make pre-releases available. The logic is that if there are two
items in the feed, the 2nd will be the beta (!). Because this version
will always compare higher, it means that it is possible that any
new download is actually a beta version. Presumably one of these
eventually becomes a final release, but because of this ambiguity,
it is recommended to actually verify the build number against what
can be downloaded from the download link at:
