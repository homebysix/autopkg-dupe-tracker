            - **Description**: Downloads Firefox, packages it, and copies the package to a local path of your choosing.
Input keys [Firefox pkg documentation taken from parent recipe]:
- Values for RELEASE correspond to directories here: http://download-origin.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/
Some useful values are: 'latest', 'latest-24.0esr', 'latest-esr', 'latest-3.6', 'latest-beta'
- LOCALE corresponds to directories at http://download-origin.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/$FIREFOX_BUILD/mac/
Examples include 'en-US', 'de', 'ja-JP-mac', 'sv-SE', and 'zh-TW'
No idea if all Firefox builds are available in all the same localizations, so you may need to verify that any particular
combination is offered.
- DS_PKGS_PATH is the destination path for the copy. A trailing slash is not required/desired.
  The path does not need to be on the same volume as the cache, as the pkg is being duplicated.
- DS_NAME is what the final package will be called, regardless of what was generated by the parent recipe.
  Use %NAME% for just the app name.
