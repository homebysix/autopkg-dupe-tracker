            - **Description**: Downloads latest version of Dell UltraSharp Calibration Solution (made by X-Rite), 
extracts the package installer, and then copies the package to a local path of your choosing.

Input keys:
- DS_PKGS_PATH is the destination path for the copy. A trailing slash is not required/desired.
  The path does not need to be on the same volume as the cache, as the pkg is being duplicated.
- DS_NAME is what the final package will be called, regardless of what was generated by the parent recipe.
  The default is the name Dell currently gives it; override with your own value or use %NAME% if you wish.
