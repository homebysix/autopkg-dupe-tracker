            - **Description**: Downloads the latest the Steam disk image and creates a versioned package.

Please note that the resultant package simply installs Steam.app to /Applications, but upon first launch, the Steam update process will download about 180 MB of assets to complete the installation. These support files are downloaded to ~/Library/Application Support/Steam for the current user opening the app. These assets must be downloaded for each user on the system.
