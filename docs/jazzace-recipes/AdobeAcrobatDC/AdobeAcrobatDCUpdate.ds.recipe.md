# AdobeAcrobatDCUpdate.ds.recipe

            - **Description**: Downloads latest updater for Adobe Acrobat DC and then copies the package to a local path of your choosing.
This recipe requires that the novaksam-recipes repo be present.
Input keys:
- DS_PKGS_PATH is the destination path for the copy. A trailing slash is not required/desired.
  The path does not need to be on the same volume as the cache, as the pkg is being duplicated.
- DS_NAME is what the final package will be called, regardless of what was generated by the parent recipe.
  It defaults to %NAME% (just the app name).
Note: You must use an override if you wish to specify which stream of Acrobat DC — Classic or Continuous — is downloaded.
Set MAJOR_VERSION to "Acrobat2015" to download the 'Classic Track' updates for acrobat DC instead of the Continuous track
("AcrobatDC").
