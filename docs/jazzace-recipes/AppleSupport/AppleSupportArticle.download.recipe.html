    <p>Desciption: Downloads the latest version of a particular Apple Support Article (specified in the input keys)
and, if it has updated, copies it to the designated directory as HTML, marked with the modification date
(ISO 8601 date format).

Input Keys:
    ARTICLE is the Apple Support Article number, usually two letters (HT) and six digits.
    LANG is the language and country descriptor, consisting of two letters for the language, a dash, and 
        two letters for the country (e.g., en-us). Many will want to force the US version in order to get
        the earliest indication of a change. 
    SAVE_LOCATION is the path to the directory where the HTML file should be saved. The path should exist.
