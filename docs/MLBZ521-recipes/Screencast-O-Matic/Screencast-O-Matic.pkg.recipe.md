            - **Description**: Downloads the Screencast-O-Matic disk image and builds a package.

The Screencast-O-Matic application (in my opinion) is poorly designed.  The user has to own .app for them to be able to launch it.

So....that said...That means only one user on any system can actually use this app.  I'm trying to get in contact them to figure this out.
