            - **Description**: Creates a package from a pre-downloaded JMP installer which has already been installed on a client, and the SIP file converted to a JMP.per file as per the instructions in the JMP Deployment Guide.
You need to manually supply the JMP version, since attempts to extract this from the installer have so far failed.
