# DaVinciResolve16.download.recipe

            _Last updated 2021-12-23 19:58:07Z_

            - **Description**: Downloads latest version of DaVinci Resolve 16.

This recipe is a modification of Tim Sutton's original v14
recipe.

This product requires registration in order to download, so
you _must_ override all input variables beginning with 'REG_'
and they must contain data.

Notably, REG_STATE and REG_COUNTRY must contain sane values:
- REG_COUNTRY is of the form 'us', 'ca', etc.
- REG_STATE is a proper name, i.e. 'Maryland'.
