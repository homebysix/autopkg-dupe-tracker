- **Description**: Downloads and builds a package that installs exa, an improved file lister with more features and better defaults. It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And itâ€™s small, fast, and just one single binary. The resulting package installs to /usr/local/bin/exa
