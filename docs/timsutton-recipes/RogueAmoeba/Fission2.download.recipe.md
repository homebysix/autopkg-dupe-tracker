            - **Description**: Downloads the most recent version of Fission 2.

SYSTEM_VERSION is a minimum OS version expressed as a four-character
integer, i.e. (10majorminor), which is sent to the RA Sparkle feed
server. Fission 2 currently requires 10.7, but it's possible that
later revisions will require a higher OS, so this may be overridden.
