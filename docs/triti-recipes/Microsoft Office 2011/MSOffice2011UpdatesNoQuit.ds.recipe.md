# MSOffice2011UpdatesNoQuit.ds.recipe

            - **Description**: Downloads latest version of MS Office 2011, builds a package, and copies it to 
the DeployStudio packages repository.
Input keys:
- DS_PKGS_PATH is the path for the Packages folder in the DeployStudio 
  repository (trailing slash not required/desired).
  The path does not need to be on the same volume as the cache, as the pkg is 
  being duplicated.
- DS_NAME is what the final package will be called in DeployStudio, regardless 
  of what was generated by the parent recipe.
  It defaults to %NAME% (the update name) and the version number is appended 
  when the update is copied to the DeployStudio repository.
