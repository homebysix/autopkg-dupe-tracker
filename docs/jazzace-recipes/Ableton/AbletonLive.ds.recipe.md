            - **Description**: Downloads the most recent version of Ableton Live, creates an installer package,
and copies it to a local location of your choosing.
Input keys:
- The LIVE_VERS (major version) and EDITION (e.g., studio, lite) are described in the parent download recipe.
- DS_PKGS_PATH is the destination path for the copy. A trailing slash is not required/desired.
  The path does not need to be on the same volume as the cache.
- DS_NAME is what the final package will be called when duplicated, regardless of what was generated by the parent recipe.
  It defaults to %NAME%.
