            - **Description**: Downloads latest version of Fetch, packages it, and then copies the package to a local repository.
Requires jleggat-recipes.
Input keys:
- DS_PKGS_PATH is the destination path for the copy. A trailing slash is not required/desired.
  The path does not need to be on the same volume as the cache, as the pkg is being duplicated.
- DS_NAME is what the final package will be called in your local repository, regardless of what was generated by the parent recipe.
  It defaults to %NAME% (just the app name).


            - **Identifier**: `com.github.jazzace.ds.Fetch`

            - **Parent Recipes**: `com.github.jleggat.pkg.Fetch`
