    <p>Desciption: Packages the latest version of Audacity and then copies the package to a local path of your choosing.
This recipe requires the scriptingosx-recipes repo. As well, you must manually download 
the latest version from http://www.audacityteam.org/download/mac/ and then run this recipe 
from the command line with the --pkg option. For example:
    autopkg run Audacity.ds --pkg ~/Downloads/audacity-macosx-ub-2.1.2.dmg
More details can be found in the ReadMe found with the parent recipe.

Input keys:
- DS_PKGS_PATH is the destination path for the copy. A trailing slash is not required/desired.
  The path does not need to be on the same volume as the cache, as the pkg is being duplicated.
- DS_NAME is what the final package will be called, regardless of what was generated by the parent recipe.
  It defaults to %NAME% (just the app name).
