# MeshLabPreRelease.ds.recipe

            _Last updated 2021-12-23 19:58:07Z_

            - **Description**: Downloads latest pre-release version of MeshLab, packages it, and then copies to an arbitrary local location.
Unlike most .ds recipes, this recipe does not rename the pkg (version information is maintained).
Input keys:
- DS_PKGS_PATH is the destination path for the copy. A trailing slash is not required/desired.
  The path does not need to be on the same volume as the cache, as the pkg is being duplicated.
- DS_NAME is what the final package will be called, regardless of what was generated by the parent recipe.
  It defaults to %NAME% (just the app name).
